# TUTACjs
A JavaScript implementation of the TUTor Automatic Computer (TUTAC), a theoretical computer designed to aid understanding of computers and computer programming techniques. The design of TUTAC was detailed in the 1964 book "Computer Programming Techniques" by Theodore G. Scott, originally published in the US by U.S. Industries, Inc. and in Great Britain by Macdonald & Co. (Publishers) London.[1]

[WORK IN PROGRESS]

NOTES:

[1] TUTAC was originally described in an earlier book called "Basic Computer Programming" by the same author in 1962, originally published in the US by Doubleday & Company, Inc., Garden City, N.Y. Any differences (if any) between the theoretical implementation of TUTAC as described in this book and the later one will be documented.
